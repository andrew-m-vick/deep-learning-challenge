# Deep Learning Model Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis

The primary purpose of this analysis was to develop a deep learning model capable of predicting the success of funding applications for charitable organizations. The model utilized historical data on various attributes of these organizations and their applications to learn patterns indicative of successful funding outcomes.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- **Target Variable(s)**: The target variable for our model is IS_SUCCESSFUL, which indicates whether a funding application was successful (1) or not (0).
- **Feature Variables**: The features used for the model include various attributes of the organizations and their applications, such as APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT.
- **Variables Removed**: The variables EIN and NAME were removed from the input data as they are unique identifiers and organization names, respectively, and do not contribute meaningful information for predicting funding success.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

**Neural Network Architecture**: The initial model architecture consisted of:

- Two hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons, respectively.
- ReLU activation function for both hidden layers.
- Binary cross-entropy loss function.
- Adam optimizer.
- Accuracy as the evaluation metric.

This configuration was chosen as a starting point for its relative simplicity and common use in binary classification problems. ReLU activation was selected for its computational efficiency and ability to mitigate vanishing gradient issues.

**Target Model Performance**: The target model performance was to achieve an accuracy above 75%.

**Steps to Increase Model Performance**: Several optimization attempts were made to improve the model's performance:

- **Bucketing** ASK_AMT: The ASK_AMT variable was bucketed into ranges to capture potential non-linear relationships with funding success.
- **Reducing Category Counts**: The number of unique categories in APPLICATION_TYPE and CLASSIFICATION was reduced by grouping infrequent categories into an "Other" category. This aimed to simplify the model and prevent overfitting to rare categories.
- **Adjusting Network Architecture**: The number of layers and neurons was experimented with, adding and removing layers and changing the number of neurons in each layer.
- **Adding Dropout**: Dropout layers were introduced to randomly deactivate a fraction of neurons during training, helping to prevent overfitting.
- **Changing Batch Size**: The batch size used during training was adjusted to explore its impact on model performance.

## Summary

The deep learning model achieved a reasonable level of accuracy in predicting the success of funding applications. However, the target performance of 75% accuracy was not consistently met across the optimization attempts. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of around 73%.

### Recommendation for a Different Model:

An alternative approach could involve using a Random Forest classifier. Random Forests are ensemble models that combine multiple decision trees, often leading to improved predictive performance and robustness to overfitting. They can handle both categorical and numerical features well and provide insights into feature importance. By leveraging these advantages, a Random Forest classifier might offer a promising alternative for predicting funding success and potentially outperform the deep learning model explored in this analysis.
